# GAM Visualization
An interactive visualization of GAM models using R Shiny package.

## Description
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer ways to capture multi-variate relationships. In this interactive visualization, the user can select variables to build an arbitrarily complex GAM, then view the predicted surface plots and isocontour plots for two selected variables.

The intended context of this application is in neuroimaging. A dummy dataset has been supplied for illustrative purposes.
